##My personal example of an E-Commerce website using React.js, Express.js and MongDB



# Setup:
1) In order to make the project run, you need to have node installed, if not please download from *https://nodejs.org/en/download/*

2) Change directory to **< location_of_repo >/e-commerce-website_React.js/backend** and run ```npm install``` in the console/terminal/cmd_prompt. This will install the backend part of the project - Express.js

3) Change directory to **< location_of_repo >/e-commerce-website_React.js/frontend** and run ```npm install``` in the console/terminal/cmd_prompt. This will install the frontend part of the project - React.js



# How to run 

* Open two terminals, one for backend and one for frontend. ***It is important to run the command for backend first!***
    * Backend - change directory to <location of repo/e-commerce-website_React.js/backend, and run the following command:
    ```node app.js```
    
    * Frontend - change directory to <location of repo/e-commerce-website_React.js/frontend, and run the following command:
    ```npm start```



# Side notes

* The project currently runs only on Mobile View, which means the UI for desktop is still in construction, therefore for a better experience, please reduce the width of the browser in between 500 - 750 px

* The DB is situated on my MongoDB Atlas Cluster, therefore it is not possible to modify it directly
