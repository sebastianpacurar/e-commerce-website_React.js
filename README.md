## My personal example of an E-Commerce website using React.js, Express.js and MongoDB

##### There are 2 versions of the project, one with front-end implementation only, and one with back-end and front-end:

* branch ***master-frontend*** (the branch you are viewing now) contains the front-end implementation only version (no DB connection)

* branch [***master***](https://github.com/sebastianpacurar/e-commerce-website_React.js/tree/master) contains the front-end and back-end implementation with MongoDB.

<br />

# Important Notes

* The project currently runs only on Mobile View, which means the UI for desktop is still under construction, therefore for a better experience, after you run the program, please reduce the width of the browser in between 500 - 750 px, and refresh the page.

<br/>

# Setup:
1) **In order to make the project run, you need to have node.js installed**

    * Windows users:
        * Node.js - please download from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), and perform the installation.
             
    * Linux users:
        * Node.js - please follow these [instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).
        
    * MacOS users:
        * Node.js - please download from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), and perform the installation.     
<br />

2) **Install node modules for front-end**:    
    * Open a terminal, change directory to **<path_to_repo>/e-commerce-website_React.js** and run ```npm install``` in the terminal.

<br/>

# How to run
* Open one terminal, change directory to **<location_of_repo>/e-commerce-website_React.js**, and run the following command:
    ```
        npm start
    ```
    * It will open a new browser window with the ```http://localhost:3000/``` URL. if this does not happen, please access it by yourself.
